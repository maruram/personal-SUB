### Mentoring-scheme-2022
## What is this?
This is a repository containing all of the course material for the mentoring scheme between myself and **Marura Mulumba**.

## Made with:
Training Course Material to produce portfolio will include the below; 
- HTML template
- CSS / SASS
- Vanilla JS
-React

## Outcome:
Initially, this will be a 6 week mentoring scheme where fundamentals will be taught and practiced. The main outcome will be a fully working portfolio which will be created with the above tech to showcase these new front end skills. 

## Future:
Once we have put into practice vanilla JS, the plan is to refactor this portfolio in React.
